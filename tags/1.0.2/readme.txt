Creates phases to organize your posts.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to keep track of the status of your posts as you work through each phase of creating them.

= Why Use Phases? =

Phases helps you stay organized as you progress through the steps of creating your posts. The steps from start to finish may differ, but Phases lets you keep track of your progress at a glance.

By default, phases comes with To Do, Doing Done phases, but you can change this to suit your needs. For instance, if you're entering content, maybe you want a Not Started, Rough Draft, Edited, and Approved phases for your posts; or, if you're testing a site, maybe you want Untested, QA, QC, Final phases. The phases you choose are up to you!

You can also enable notes to keep track of why a post is in a particular phase. For instance, you could have a phase called Blocked and list the reasons each post is blocked, like "blocked because missing hero image, missing author bio, missing accurate pricing" and so forth.
